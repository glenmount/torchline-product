# Torchline — TRIDENT (Families) & SENTINEL (Facilities)

**Motto:** Scorch the old. Sanctify the fragile. Light the path.

**North Star:** Rebuild aged care’s trust layer as a sovereign, receipts-first system that gives families zero-click clarity and lifts residents’ Dignity Minutes (DM%). Everything ships with dates, sources, and guardrails.

## Products
- **TRIDENT (Families):** Source-linked copilot for fees/rights/safety with date-aware answers and a deterministic fee engine.
- **SENTINEL (Facilities):** DM% uplift via tiny, reversible, receipt-backed nudges. Surveillance-Zero. Fairness freeze at ≥1.0 pp gap.

## Rails
ASK → DECIDE → ACT (v0) → RECORD. No source, no ship. Privacy by design. Deterministic where it matters.

**Docs:** see /docs
**Code:** see /trident-app and /sentinel-kits, shared components in /torchline-core
