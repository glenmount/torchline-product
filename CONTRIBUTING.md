# Contributing (Torchline Product)

**Rails (non-negotiable):**
- No source, no ship (every claim must show dated sources).
- Zero-click clarity (fewer clicks than last iteration or explain why not).
- Pilgrims only (scars over resumes); Death Sprints (4-day prove-or-kill).
- Verification or Vapor: undocumented heuristics expire in ≤14 days unless source-verified.

**Cadence:** Mon targets → Thu fragility mining → Fri demo (cite it or kill it).

**How to add work:** Propose a user story under SENTINEL or TRIDENT with Outcomes, KPIs, ACs. Link to canon in `docs/canon/`.
