# SENTINEL Roadmap (Facilities)

**Goal:** Lift Dignity Minutes (DM%) while protecting privacy (Surveillance-Zero) and fairness (freeze at ≥1.0 pp gap).

## Thin Slice (first 10 days)
- Live Queue (Next Best 3) for carers
- Sterile-Cockpit guards (med rounds)
- Hydration/continence prompts
- Ambient documentation (object-only)
- Break guarantees & duress muster
- Weekly Stress Report

**Pass gate (Day 10):**  
DM% +15%; >8-min bells −25%; interruptions −30%; charting −50%; incidents −15%; bias drift <1 pp; privacy incidents 0.

## Receipts & Safety
- ≤2 citations shown, 3 logged with block hash; p95 < 1s; byte-identical 5×.
- Surveillance-Zero: no cameras/raw audio; edge-only signals.
- Freeze if fairness gap ≥1.0 pp; publish fix plan.

## Next
- Kits: Night Safety, Ambient Docs, Family Receipts & Reg Pack
- Weekly DM% reporting + Journey exports (integrity codes)
