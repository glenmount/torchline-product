# TORCHLINE NORTH STAR — TRIDENT + SENTINEL

**Motto:** Scorch the old. Sanctify the fragile. Light the path.  
**North Star:** Receipts-first trust layer for aged care: zero-click clarity for families, DM% up for facilities.

## Beliefs → Operating Law (abridged)
1) No source, no ship. 2) Zero-click clarity; clicks trigger Friction Autopsy.  
3) Pilgrims only. 4) Stack Gospel: Data→Analytics→Prediction→Action→Empathy.  
5) Lived-Experience QA. 6) Fragility mined weekly. 7) Verification or vapor (14-day sunset).  
8) Bias by design; fairness gates. 9) Impossible deadlines. 10) Purge meter for legacy.

## Rails (shared)
ASK → DECIDE → ACT (v0) → RECORD with explicit consent + integrity hashes.

## Path A — SENTINEL (Facilities)
**Goal:** DM% ↑, bells >8min ↓, interruptions ↓, incidents ↓, charting time ↓ 40–60%, fairness gap <1.0pp, privacy incidents 0.  
**Thin slice (10 days):** Live Queue (Next Best 3), Sterile-Cockpit guards, Hydration prompts, Ambient Documentation (object-only), Break guarantees, Duress muster, Weekly Stress Report.  
**Pass Gate:** DM% +15%; bells −25%; interruptions −30%; charting −50%; incidents −15%; fairness drift <1pp; privacy=0.

## Path B — TRIDENT (Families)
**Phase 0 DoD:**  
1) 150 NSW homes with 4+ docs (agreement/admissions, pricing, ACQSC report, complaints policy).  
2) Canonical national docs (fees, MPIR, subsidies, care-minutes, star methodology, Charter, SIRS...).  
3) Date-aware retrieval; fee-math uses **agreement-date MPIR**.  
4) Demo UI: cited answers <4s p95; compare 2–3 homes; fee calculator.  
5) Eval: 50 Qs; numeric ±$0.01; citations ≥95%; date scope ≥90%; perf p95 <4s.

## Impossible Path (guardrails)
Surveillance-Zero. Fairness freezes. Determinism (receipts p95<1s; answers p95<4s). Kill-switches on red lines.

## 0–180d Roadmap (Now/Next/Later)
- Weeks 0–2: rails + registries + consent/receipt formats.
- Weeks 3–6: Sentinel (DM Coach v0, Stress Report v0); Trident (fee-math v1, retrieval+templating, UI v1).
- Weeks 7–12: fairness ops; 150 homes; evals green; observability.
- 90–180d: Sentinel kits (night safety, ambient docs); Trident provider self-serve & journey exports.
